Write Documentation
===================
ISiCLE could always use more documentation, or have existing documentation improved upon. 
These include the documentation you are reading now, docstrings, tutorials, or even on the web as blog posts or articles.
Please reference the documentation guidelines below.
Changes to documentation should be submitted as pull requests.

-------------------------
Submitting a Pull Request
-------------------------

To update the documentation, fix bugs, or add new features you need to create a pull request.
Any changes you make to your local copy of the code will be made easily available for review and eventual integration into the code base.
To create a pull request:

#. Create a GitHub account
#. Fork the repository
#. Clone your fork locally
#. Go to the created isicle folder with :code:`cd isicle`
#. Create a new branch with :code:`git checkout -b <descriptive_branch_name>`
#. Make your changes to the code or documentation
#. Run :code:`git add -A` to add all the changed files to the commit
#. To commit the added files, run :code:`git commit -m '<text>'` or :code:`git commit`. The latter will open a command line editor to write a commit message. Commit messages should have a descriptive line header (<50 characters, including spaces), followed by an empty line, and then a description of what you did and why. We also ask that the header be of the style "This commit will <commit message>", with the first letter capitalized and no trailing period. Please see existing commit history for examples.
#. Push your changes to your isicle fork by running :code:`git push origin <descriptive_branch_name>`
#. If you then navigate to the webpage for your isicle fork, you should see a "Pull request" link in the sidebar. Choose the relevant pull request from the menu and click the "Create Pull Request" button. Ensure the pull request target branch is <descriptive_branch_name>!

If you want to create more pull requests, first run :code:`git checkout main` and then start at step 5 with a new branch name.
